# Classification in Imbalanced Datasets

My master thesis investigates the problem of classification in imbalanced datasets provided by the Center of Evidence-Based Medecine (CEBAM, KULeuven). Hence, the research domain of this thesis can be identified by machine learning, statistics and medical diagnosis. The thesis was supervised by Dr. Evgueni Smirnov, Dr. Georgi Nalbantov and Prof. Frank Buntinx. In addition, other experts in both medical as statistical domains have been counseled on a regular basis.

I would like to thank a number of people who have made this research pos-
sible. First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors - Evgueni Smirnov,
Georgi Nalbantov and Frank Buntinx - for their tuition, time and support.
Next, I would like to thank Gijs Schoenmakers for advising me on statistical
issues. I also want to thank Ann Van den Bruel, Carla Truyers and Stefaan
Bartholomeeusen, who have directed and provided me with the knowledge from
previous research and the gathered datasets. Furthermore, many of my grati-
tude goes to my grandfather, Alfons Van Orshoven, who has raisen my interest
into the medical field and has supported this research from the very beginning.
Other gratititude goes to Frits Van Lijf, who has always supported my views.
Last but not least, I would like to thank all my friends, relatives, colleagues and
teachers who have showed interest in my work and supported me in their own
ways.
