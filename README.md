# Classification in Imbalanced Datasets

This repository contains materials related to my **Master's Thesis** titled  **"Classification in Imbalanced Datasets"**, submitted as part of the  Master's in **Artificial Intelligence** at **Maastricht University**.

## ðŸ“– About the Thesis
The thesis explores the challenges of **classification in imbalanced datasets**,  which are common in applications such as **medical diagnosis, fraud detection,  and risk management**. Traditional classification algorithms often fail to  generalize well on minority classes. This research investigates existing  methods such as **cost-sensitive learning, bagging, MetaCost, and SMOTE**,  and introduces a novel approach: **Naive Bayes Sampling (NBS)**.

## ðŸ”¬ Key Contributions
1. **Evaluation of existing techniques** for classification in imbalanced datasets.  
2. **Introduction of Naive Bayes Sampling (NBS)**, a generative method  
   that **bootstraps feature values independently** to improve minority class performance.  
3.  **Experimental validation** on UCI datasets and a **medical dataset** from KULeuven.  
4.  Comparison of NBS with standard approaches, showing its **superiority in specific settings**.
